#How to play the game
  * The object of the game is to move your player from the bottom of the playing field to the top of the playing field
    without colliding with the bugs. On the way to the top collect the stars to earn extra points!
    * You have five lives. If you hit a bug you lose a life and your character will change to the next player.
    * Every time you make it to the top of the playing field you go up a level and the enemies get faster.
    * When you run out of lives the game is over! But don't worry you can click the restart button and try again.
